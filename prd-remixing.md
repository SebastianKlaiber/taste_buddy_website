# Product Requirements Document: IntelliEdit - Seamless Remixing

**Author:** Gemini
**Date:** August 29, 2025
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Introduction

Combining elements from different photos (compositing) is a fundamental creative technique. However, it is a tedious manual process in traditional editors, requiring precise selections, layer management, and blending skills. The "Seamless Remixing" feature will leverage AI to make this process instantaneous and intuitive, unlocking creativity for all users.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

*   **Primary Goal:** Enable users to easily combine elements from two or more images into a single, cohesive new image using natural language.
*   **Secondary Goals:**
    *   Increase the creative possibilities within the app.
    *   Drive engagement by providing a fun and powerful tool for creating memes, collages, and artistic images.
    *   Reduce the time and skill required to create high-quality composite images.

## 3. Target Audience

*   **Primary:** All existing IntelliEdit users.
*   **Secondary:** Meme creators, digital artists, and social media users who want to create unique and eye-catching content.

## 4. Core Features

*   **Feature: Multi-Image Selection**
    *   **Description:** Allow users to select two or more images from their photo library as the source material for a remix.
    *   **User Story:** As a user, I want to pick a photo of my friend and a photo of a mountain so I can put my friend on the mountain.

*   **Feature: Natural Language Composition**
    *   **Description:** After selecting images, the user will use the chat interface to describe how the images should be combined. The AI will interpret the command, identify the subjects/elements, and blend them.
    *   **User Story:** As a user, I want to type "Take the person from image 1 and put them on the bench in image 2" to create a new photo.

*   **Feature: Intelligent Blending**
    *   **Description:** The AI will automatically handle complex blending tasks, such as matching lighting, color tones, and shadows between the combined elements to ensure the final image looks natural and believable.
    *   **User Story:** As a user, I want the app to automatically make the lighting on the person I added match the background, so it doesn't look fake.

## 5. User Flow

1.  User selects a "Remix" or "Composite" option from the main menu.
2.  User is prompted to select two or more images from their library.
3.  The selected images appear as thumbnails, and the user is presented with the chat interface.
4.  User types a command describing the desired composition (e.g., "Put the cat from the first image into the box from the second image").
5.  The app processes the request and generates a single new image.
6.  The user can continue to edit the newly generated image using standard chat commands.

## 6. Non-Goals (for V1 of this feature)

*   A manual, layer-based interface.
*   Non-destructive editing (i.e., the ability to individually adjust elements after they are merged).
*   Complex 3D perspective matching.

## 7. Success Metrics

*   **Adoption:** % of active users who attempt to use the Remix feature.
*   **Success Rate:** % of remix attempts that are not immediately discarded by the user.
*   **Sharing:** Number of remixed images that are saved or shared.
*   **User Satisfaction:** Qualitative feedback on the ease of use and the quality of the final composite images.
