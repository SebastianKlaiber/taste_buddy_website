            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              As someone who's deeply passionate about both cooking and software development, I found myself frustrated with the existing recipe management solutions in the market. None of them quite hit the mark in terms of what I needed as a home cook who loves to experiment and innovate in the kitchen.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              This dissatisfaction led me to create TasteBuddy - a solution that combines my technical expertise with my love for cooking. I wanted to build something that would not just store recipes, but truly enhance the cooking experience for people who share my passion for good food.
