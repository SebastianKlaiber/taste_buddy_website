                  <p>I'm Sebastian Klaiber, and that was my rock-bottom moment. As a developer who could build complex software, I couldn't figure out what to cook for dinner. I'd buy ingredients with good intentions, then watch them rot while ordering takeout... again.</p>
                  
                  <p>Sound familiar? I was trapped in the same cycle as millions of home cooks: endless food waste, decision fatigue, and the guilt of not cooking healthy meals for my family.</p>
