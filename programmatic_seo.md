1. use the firecrawl mcp to scrape thevibemarketer.com and create a.md
2. It seems there was an issue with accessing the Perplexity API for generating programmatic keyword ideas. Unfortunately, I can't proceed with that tool at the moment.

However, I can suggest some general keyword ideas for a recipe management app business based on common industry practices:

1. **Recipe Management App**
2. **Digital Recipe Keeper**
3. **Meal Planning Software**
4. **Grocery List App**
5. **AI Meal Planner**
6. **Recipe Organizer**
7. **Cooking Assistant App**
8. **Smart Recipe Import**
9. **Cloud Recipe Storage**
10. **Dietary Recipe Converter**

These keywords can be used to enhance your SEO strategy and target potential users interested in digital solutions for managing recipes and meal planning. If you need further assistance or specific keyword analysis, please let me know!
3. ok great now I want you to use the dataforse mcp to research our keywords and give me an idea
of the potential search volume of our approach
4. now i want you to create a PRD that I can use to build my first programmatic page template based on this strategy. use the information that you've gathered to prioritize a) tool comparisons b) relevant tools to thevibemarketer.com c) a high priority keyword that we can create solid content
