# Product Requirements Document: IntelliEdit MVP

**Author:** Gemini
**Date:** August 29, 2025
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Introduction

Professional-grade photo editing is powerful but suffers from a steep learning curve and complex interfaces (e.g., Adobe Photoshop). Simpler apps are easier to use but lack advanced capabilities. This creates a gap for users who want high-quality results without needing technical expertise.

**IntelliEdit** is a mobile-first photo editing app designed to bridge this gap. The MVP will test our core hypothesis: that a conversational, chat-based interface, powered by the advanced "nano banana" AI model, is a superior user experience for performing powerful photo edits.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goal
*   Validate the core product hypothesis: Users will prefer a chat-based interface for photo editing over traditional tools if it is intuitive and delivers high-quality results.

### Secondary Goals
*   Gauge user interest in the unique capabilities of the "nano banana" model (e.g., natural language understanding, object manipulation).
*   Gather qualitative feedback on the user experience to inform future development.
*   Establish baseline metrics for user engagement and retention.

## 3. Target Audience

For the MVP, the primary target audience is:

*   **Active Social Media Users & Casual Creators:** Individuals who frequently post photos to platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and X. They use their smartphones as their primary camera and desire tools that are fast, effective, and produce eye-catching results with minimal effort. They are often early adopters of novel creative applications.

## 4. MVP Core Features

The MVP is focused exclusively on validating the chat-based editing experience for a single image.

### 4.1. Platform
*   **Mobile App:** The MVP will be a native mobile application for a single platform to start: **iOS**.

### 4.2. Core User Experience
*   **Feature: Chat-Based Editing Interface**
    *   **Description:** The entire editing experience will be centered around a conversational interface. After importing a photo, the user will see their image and a text input field. All edits are initiated by the user typing commands.
    *   **User Story:** As a user, I want to type what I want to change in my photo so that I can edit it without needing to find or understand complex tools.

*   **Feature: Image Import & Export**
    *   **Description:** Users must be able to select a photo from their device's photo library to start an editing session. After editing, they must be able to save the final image back to their library or share it using the native iOS share sheet.
    *   **User Story:** As a user, I want to easily pick a photo from my camera roll to edit and save it back when I'm done.

*   **Feature: Foundational Natural Language Commands**
    *   **Description:** The app will support a curated set of editing commands that showcase the power and intuitive nature of the "nano banana" model. The focus is on quality and demonstrating core capabilities, not on the breadth of options.
    *   **MVP Command Categories:**
        1.  **Object & Background Manipulation:**
            *   Examples: "Remove the background," "delete the person on the left," "make the background blurry."
        2.  **Stylistic & Atmospheric Changes:**
            *   Examples: "Make this black and white," "turn this into a vintage photo," "make the sky look like a sunset."
        3.  **Subject Alterations:**
            *   Examples: "Change the color of my shirt to red," "add sunglasses to my face."

## 5. User Flow (MVP)

1.  User opens the IntelliEdit app.
2.  User is prompted to and selects a photo from their iOS photo library.
3.  The photo appears in the chat view with a text prompt: "What would you like to do?"
4.  User types a command (e.g., "remove the background") and submits.
5.  The app processes the request and replaces the image in the view with the edited version. The chat history shows the command.
6.  The user can type another command to further refine the image.
7.  When satisfied, the user taps a "Save/Share" button.
8.  The user can save the final image to their photo library or share it via the native iOS share sheet.

## 6. Non-Goals (What We Are NOT Building for MVP)

To ensure a focused and timely release, the following features are explicitly out of scope for the MVP:

*   **No User Accounts or Cloud Sync:** All sessions are stateless.
*   **No "Story Mode":** The MVP will not support character consistency across multiple images.
*   **No Multi-Image Remixing:** Editing is limited to one image at a time.
*   **No "One-Tap Fixes" or Filter Libraries:** The focus is entirely on the conversational interface.
*   **No Web Application or Android Version.**
*   **No Manual Editing Tools:** No brushes, layers, sliders, or cropping tools.
*   **No Real-time Camera Filters.**

## 7. Success Metrics

We will measure the success of the MVP through the following key metrics:

*   **Adoption Rate:** Total number of app downloads in the first 30 days.
*   **Activation Rate:** % of users who successfully perform at least one edit after installing.
*   **Core Task Completion Rate:** % of editing commands that result in a successful edit that the user does not immediately discard or undo.
*   **Engagement:** Average number of editing commands per user session.
*   **Retention:** Day 1 and Day 7 user retention rates.
*   **Qualitative Feedback:** Ratings and reviews in the App Store, and feedback from user surveys.
