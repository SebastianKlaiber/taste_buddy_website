## **1\. Introduction & Vision**

TasteBuddy is an intelligent, AI-powered kitchen companion designed to transform the home cooking experience. It moves beyond simple recipe storage to become an active assistant in the entire meal lifecycle. The core vision is to reduce the time, stress, and cognitive load associated with daily cooking decisions, from planning and shopping to preparation and dietary adaptation. By leveraging AI, TasteBuddy will position itself not as a digital recipe box, but as the smartest and most indispensable tool in the modern kitchen.1

## **2\. Problem & Opportunity**

### **2.1 Problem Statement**

Home cooks face several recurring challenges:

* **Decision Fatigue:** The daily question of "what to cook" is a significant source of stress.  
* **Time Consumption:** Meal planning and creating corresponding grocery lists are time-intensive manual tasks.  
* **Recipe Overload:** Digital recipes are scattered across websites, screenshots, and physical books, leading to disorganization.  
* **Dietary Complexity:** Adapting recipes to meet specific dietary needs (vegan, gluten-free, low-carb, etc.) is often difficult and requires culinary expertise.  
* **Food Waste:** Poor planning leads to unused ingredients and financial loss.

### **2.2 Opportunity**

Existing recipe keeper apps primarily function as passive digital file cabinets.2 There is a significant market opportunity for a "smarter" solution that proactively assists the user. By integrating AI at its core, TasteBuddy can offer a fundamentally different and more valuable user experience, automating complex tasks and providing personalized guidance that competitors cannot.1
