# Product Requirements Document: IntelliEdit - Story Mode

**Author:** Gemini
**Date:** August 29, 2025
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Introduction

Following the successful validation of the core chat-based editing MVP, the "Story Mode" feature addresses the next major pain point in creative AI: character consistency. Content creators, marketers, and storytellers struggle to maintain the appearance of a single character across a series of images. This feature will provide a powerful, unique solution to create visual narratives.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

*   **Primary Goal:** Enable users to create a series of images featuring a consistent character in different scenes and poses.
*   **Secondary Goals:**
    *   Increase user engagement and retention by providing a powerful, long-form creation tool.
    *   Differentiate IntelliEdit from competitors by offering a unique feature not widely available in other editors.
    *   Attract a new segment of creative and professional users (storyboard artists, comic creators, etc.).

## 3. Target Audience

*   **Primary:** Social Media Managers, Content Marketers, and small business owners creating campaigns or narrative content.
*   **Secondary:** Comic artists, storyboard artists, writers, and hobbyists looking to visualize stories.

## 4. Core Features

*   **Feature: Character Creator**
    *   **Description:** Allow a user to define a persistent character. This can be done by uploading one or more reference photos. The AI will create a model of the character that can be used in subsequent image generations.
    *   **User Story:** As a comic artist, I want to upload a drawing of my main character so that I can generate new images of them in different situations.

*   **Feature: Scene Generation**
    *   **Description:** Within a "Story," users can use the chat interface to generate scenes featuring their created character(s). Prompts will be ableto reference the character by name.
    *   **User Story:** As a marketer, I want to type "Show [My Character] using our new product on a beach" to generate a promotional image.

*   **Feature: Story Gallery**
    *   **Description:** A dedicated view within the app to see all images created for a specific "Story" in a sequential, gallery, or timeline format. Users can re-order, delete, or select an image to perform further edits using the main chat interface.
    *   **User Story:** As a user, I want to see all my generated scenes in order so I can check the flow of my narrative.

## 5. User Flow

2.  User is prompted to create a new Character, uploading reference images.
